# Setlists

## Available Song Functions
* HarryPotter
* CantinaBand
* Pacman
* TakeOnMe

Additional songs can be found [HERE](https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs)

Please note that you will need to delete a song for every new one you add. This involves deleting the function from both setlist.h and setlist.ino. Additionally, you will need to make a new prototype in setlist.h

This is done to conserve memory on the arduino nano.
